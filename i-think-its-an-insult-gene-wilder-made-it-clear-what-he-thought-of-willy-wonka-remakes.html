<time>10 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=1037 data-injectable=true data-video=true>With the trailer for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonka</a> dropping yesterday, eager fans who’ve been waiting to see how Timothée Chalamet tackles the famous character in a prequel nobody asked for were given their first taste of the new film. And, let’s just say, it didn’t taste quite as sweet as many were expecting, with plenty of watchers finding the small slice of the talented actor’s performance that was revealed to us was lacking when it came to edge, and overdone on the whimsy to the point of being awkward. Additionally, many fans are worried that the plot will be overly generic, which is something that can’t be said about the Roald Dahl novel that it’s based on. Chalamet — despite being a brilliant performer who’s displayed a ton of range in films as diverse as Call Me By Your Name, Dune, and Don’t Look Up — was always going to be subject to these kinds of criticisms, mostly because of the celebrated performance that came from the most famous Wonka to have ever graced our screens: <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gene Wilder</a></strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=661 data-current-count=961 data-injectable=true>The legendary actor had a life worthy of the films he was in, and he was also totally unafraid to speak his mind on a wide range of topics, but especially the film industry. Although he made his name as a comedic actor in the films of the equally legendary Mel Brooks (Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein) and is widely known for starring alongside his fellow funnyman Richard Pryor (See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Stire Crazy), he is undoubtedly most famous for his iconic portrayal of Willy Wonka in the classic 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. And it’s this performance that has become the benchmark that Chalamet is now struggling to beat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-26.png><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=876 data-injectable=true>Wilder was never afraid to voice his opinions on all kinds of matters, including his dissatisfaction with Hollywood, and a particular hate for the dull, unoriginal projects that flooded cinemas in the latter part of his life. So, it makes sense that in a rare interview in 2013 with famous film historian Robert Osborne he was unequivocal about his dislike of the 2005 Willy Wonka film, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. When asked if he was “bothered” by remakes of his classic films (with Osborne specifically name-checking 1971s Willy Wonka), Wilder responded:</p><p>“Oh, I think it’s an insult. And it’s probably Warner Brothers’ insult, I think. I like Warner Brothers for other reasons, but to do that with Johnny Depp… ooo. Who I think is a good actor, and I like him, but I don’t care for that director [Tim Burton]. And he’s a talented man, but I don’t care for him for doing stuff like he did.”</p><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=866 data-injectable=true>Not exactly mincing his words, and given what we’ve seen of the trailer for the new movie (which is directed by Paddington‘s Paul King), we’re not entirely sure he’d have anything more positive to say about the upcoming Wonka. The movie will be a musical fantasy, and chronicles the famous chocolate maker’s early life as he struggles to build his sweet empire. Other stars who will appear include Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, and Olivia Coleman.</p><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>Unlike what we’ve seen from Chalamet so far (and the thankfully forgettable slop that Johnny Depp served up), Wilder managed to convey a hint of menace that made watchers of the 1971 movie worry that he might, in fact, simply let all the kids in the factory die, and probably laugh about it after. Throughout the film, the magical-seeming chocolatier has a faery-like edge to him, but in a more traditional, mischievous and occasionally dangerous sense rather than the more modern interpretation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-27.png><p data-characters=585 data-current-count=885 data-injectable=true>It’s this interplay between the childish, whimsical world of chocolate and the cold-hearted, almost ghost story-like mythos that Wonka displays in the 1971 film that makes Wilder’s turn as the boss of the Oompa-Loompas so memorable. Sadly, it appears Chalamet hasn’t managed to channel this; whether it’s because of a poor script, or simply a rare case of a trailer utilizing the worst bits of a film instead of its high moments, will only be revealed when the new movie is released. At least we know it can’t be worse than the indulgent Depp/Burton mess.</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=61 data-injectable=false>Wonka is set to hit our screens on December 15 of this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2bsDHoqWkZZmpwG6tzWagp6ulocFus8SnnGavmaGxpr6MppidnV2ewW6vy56Yq2Wnna61eceeZK2gn6q0qcCMqJ1mr5mhubp51qilpJldp7Kurcqeqmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-think-its-an-insult-gene-wilder-made-it-clear-what-he-thought-of-willy-wonka-remakes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fi-think-its-an-insult-gene-wilder-made-it-clear-what-he-thought-of-willy-wonka-remakes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fi-think-its-an-insult-gene-wilder-made-it-clear-what-he-thought-of-willy-wonka-remakes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fi-think-its-an-insult-gene-wilder-made-it-clear-what-he-thought-of-willy-wonka-remakes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-think-its-an-insult-gene-wilder-made-it-clear-what-he-thought-of-willy-wonka-remakes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-think-its-an-insult-gene-wilder-made-it-clear-what-he-thought-of-willy-wonka-remakes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./maushold-pok-c3-a9mon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./maushold-pok-c3-a9mon.html>Maushold (Pokmon) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./96635-anele-excited-after-interviewing-us-talk-show-host-wendy-williams-html.html>Anele Excited After Interviewing US Talk Show Host Wendy Williams</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./96635-anele-excited-after-interviewing-us-talk-show-host-wendy-williams-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
