He has been reportedly married to three women with whom he shares children. Below are the women he has been married to and his present wife:</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-first-mariage-was-to-a-british-writer></span><strong>His First Mariage was to a British Writer</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The first love story of the literature guru was with British writer Barbara Dixton. The duo met at the University of Leeds in the 1950s and got married in 1958 while Wole Soyinka was still a student.
