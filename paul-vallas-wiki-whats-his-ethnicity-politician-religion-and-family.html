<time>14 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>People are interested in Paul Vallas’ faith since he is now generating news as a Democratic contender for mayor in 2023. Paul finished top in the first round of voting and will now progress to the runoff round. Vallas is expected to face up against incumbent Lori Lightfoot.&nbsp;Lightfoot made history four years ago when she became the first Black woman to be elected mayor of Chicago, winning all 50 wards. However, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot was defeated in her re-election campaign on Tuesday.</p><p>During the epidemic, Chicago had an increase in violent crime, and voters were unsatisfied with her management of crime and police in the city. Paul Vallas, a former public school leader, and Brandon Johnson, a county board commissioner, were the two candidates that proceeded to the April 4 runoff.</p><h2>Paul Vallas’s Religion: Is He Christian Or Jewish?</h2><p>The politician has not said which faith he follows. He may be an Orthodox Christian due to his Greek-American parentage. Vallas started his work in the early 1980s as a budget analyst for the City of Chicago. He then worked as the city’s budget director and as Mayor Richard M. Daley’s chief of staff.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Paul-Vallas-1.jpg alt="Paul Vallas" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Vallas was named CEO of the Chicago Public Schools in 1995, where he oversaw major increases in student performance, test scores, and graduation rates.

Her parents’ names have not been revealed by the politician.&nbsp;His parents were also Greek immigrants who emigrated to the United States. Vallas grew up on Chicago’s South Side in the Roseland neighborhood.&nbsp;He grew raised in the Chicago suburbs, and throughout his adolescence, he lived in Palos Heights.</p><p>Vallas graduated from Carl Sandburg High School and attended Moraine Valley Community College. He graduated from Western Illinois University with a bachelor’s degree in history and a master’s degree in political science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
