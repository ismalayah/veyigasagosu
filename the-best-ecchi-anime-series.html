Ecchi <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anime</a></strong> walks a fine line between explicit and dirty. And you may already be familiar with some of the most popular series.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>The term “ecchi” refers to anime with highly suggestive sexual content. These shows usually feature gratuitous fanservice, fetish fuel, and even non-explicit sex scenes. But fondling aside, ecchi isn’t quite as hardcore as hentai. In fact, many ecchi series are satirical, poking fun at fanservice or posing larger questions about sexuality’s place in the medium.</p><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Interested in checking out a couple ecchi series yourself? Here are our top recommendations.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The best ecchi anime series</h2><h3 data-injectable=false>Kill la Kill</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=true>High schooler Ryuko Matoi is no average student. She’s on a quest to avenge her late father, and to do so, she turns to the elite Honnouji Academy for answers. Honnouji’s students receive incredible power by wearing Goku Uniforms, and the entire school is dominated by a Goku-centric class structure. In a bid to challenge the school’s student council and its head Satsuki, Ryuko finds a sentient uniform, Senketsu, that gives her incredible power—and proves a little more than revealing.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>Kill la Kill is part ecchi, part satire, but has a wonderful message attached to it about female sexual empowerment. Expect a tongue-in-cheek romp with some of Trigger’s most incredible action scenes to date.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Panty and Stocking Anarchy are two angels booted down to Earth due to their indulgent vices: Sex and sweets, respectively. If the two want to make their way back to Heaven, they must venture through Daten City and collect Heaven Coins from demonic entities haunting the city’s residents. The journey back to the celestial realm only seems to enable their antics, however, as Panty soon finds herself bedding one human after another.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Produced by Gainax, Panty & Stocking is best known for one of anime’s most iconic transformation scenes: Panty and Stocking’s <a href=#>strip tease</a>, where they transform their namesakes into holy weapons that can kill demons. Expect plenty more lewd jokes and antics throughout the series, particularly on Panty’s part.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Shimoneta: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesn’t Exist</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>In a dystopian world where all forms of sexual artwork and public sexual expression are outlawed, a ragtag group of teenagers seek to free Japan from authoritarian surveillance. Led by the charismatic and highly perverted Ayame Kajou, these lewd “terrorists” freely crack lewd jokes, distribute suggestive content, and encourage others to join their ranks as they attempt to sabotage the government’s crusade against all things smutty.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>Part satire, part fanservice, and filled with an incredibly dirty sense of humor, Shimoneta is an ecchi with a heart—one that looks at just how terrible life would be if sexuality was repressed on a societal scale.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Interspecies Reviewers</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>A fan-favorite among monster girl lovers, Interspecies Reviewers poses an intriguing question: What if sex work was decriminalized, and you could visit brothels to hook up with catgirls and elves? Certainly, you would need three intrepid reviewers to take up the task, sacrificing their time, energy, and stamina to check out one species after another. What a brave crew.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true>Interspecies Reviewers is an erotic comedy that leans into its fantasies, delights in its quirky fanservice, and revels in a raunchy sense of humor. No better example exists than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crimvael</a>, the shy, nonbinary, intersex angel who actually <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">outranks the show’s men</a> when it comes to size.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Monster Musume: Everyday Life with Monster Girls</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>Speaking of anime about monster women, few can match harem ecchi-comedy Monster Musume. This series follows part-timer Kimihito Kurusu, who mistakenly receives a Lamia named Miia as part of a species exchange program. Miia tries in vain to seduce Kimihito, but the program explicitly bans sexual interactions between the two. Tensions only grow as Kimihito meets one species after another, each encounter featuring just as much fanservice and humor as the last.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>When it comes to harem anime, Monster Musume is a clever series that builds its harem dynamic through intricate character relationships and personalities. If slice-of-life harem anime is your thing, don’t skip this one.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Food Wars!</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>Combining food and sex almost makes too much sense. So it’s no surprise Food Wars! is one incredibly popular ecchi series.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>When aspiring culinary student Soma Yukihira joins the Totsuki Saryo Culinary Institute, he soon finds himself surrounded by an eclectic group of talented chefs-in-training. These include a number of female characters who really enjoy themselves when they eat incredible food. Really, really enjoy themselves. Expect <a href=#>flushed faces</a>, moaning, and <a href=#>even some nudity</a> at the end of Food Wars!’s intense cook-off scenes.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=206 data-injectable=false>As far as ecchi go, Food Wars! is easily one of the more tasteful—no pun intended. The series perfectly blends Soma’s journey with a bit of dirty humor and fanservice sure to delight any shonen fan.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Bakemonogatari</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=621 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>Bakemonogatari is a plot-focused anime series first, ecchi second. The series follows Koyomi Araragi, a part-human, part-vampire high school student trying to return to normalcy after surviving a traumatic vampire attack. This proves harder than it may seem, and Koyomi’s life remains intertwined with the supernatural world he’s been thrust into. With class president Tsubasa Hanekawa by Koyomi’s side, Bakemonogatari invests hard in its characters and keeps the ecchi material more akin to occasional fanservice. This keeps the series far more tasteful and subtle than some of the others on this list.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Chobits</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>Madhouse’s seinen series Chobits premiered in 2002 and inspired much of the 2000s ecchi landscape. The series follows 18-year-old Hideki Motosuwa, a prep school student who yearns to own an advanced personal assistant called a Persocom. When he stumbles across a beautiful female Persocom and takes her home, he soon learns she is one of the rarest around: A Chobit. Naming her Chi, the two bond over the course of the anime as Chi becomes acquainted to human life.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>While the ecchi and fanservice in Chobits isn’t quite as blatant as some of the other series on this list, it’s still highly present. Hideki is as perverted as they come, and when Chi stumbles across Hideki’s pornographic collection, she learns more than a thing or two about seduction. Expect plenty of lewd humor, and more than a few suggestive undertones.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Golden Boy</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Hilarious and filled with equal parts slapstick and suggestive moments, Golden Boy was the original blueprint for so many modern ecchi anime series. Based on the seinen manga of the same name, Golden Boy follows Kintaro Oe as he falls for one woman after another and tries to gain their affection. More often than not, Kintaro eventually woes their hearts, but not after making a buffoon of himself numerous times.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>Golden Boy’s six-part anime series and its OVA paved the way for much of the ecchi genre as we know it today, particularly ecchi’s fanservice and adult sense of humor. While Golden Boy may feel a little dated compared to far more sophisticated contemporary satire anime like Kill la Kill or Panty & Stocking, it’s still worth returning to for understanding the genre’s roots.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Prison School</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=690 data-current-count=990 data-injectable=true>Hachimitsu Private Academy is one of the most prestigious all-female academies there is. Recently, the school has decided to let in male students. It’s a nice gesture on paper, but in reality, high schooler Kiyoshi Fujino quickly realizes he’s only one of five boys attending the academy’s first co-ed year. And some of the school’s women aren’t happy about their new classmates. The five boys are soon framed for a voyuerism incident and forced into an on-campus prison, hence the anime’s name. There, the Underground Student Council torments all five men and keeps the school’s women in check, all while Kiyoshi seeks a way out from imprisonment.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Prison School is easily one of the most intense, and hilarious, ecchi anime on this list. The fanservice here walks hand-in-hand with plenty of BDSM play; the series was practically built for sadomasochistic femdom segments, including all the whipping, spanking, and humiliation you can imagine. Expect plenty of dark humor, often at the main characters’ expense.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmmZ6rpGKypK%2FHomSappmism6%2FxKugnqtf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-best-ecchi-anime-series.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-best-ecchi-anime-series.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-best-ecchi-anime-series.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-best-ecchi-anime-series.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-best-ecchi-anime-series.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-ecchi-anime-series.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./annarah-cymone.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./annarah-cymone.html>Annarah Cymone Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./slickast-review.html>Slickast Review {Feb 2023} Check The Details Here!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./slickast-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
