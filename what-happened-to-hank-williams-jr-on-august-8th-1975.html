I am a very blessed and thankful man. HWJR <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yU8nY70a5s</a></p>— Hank Williams, Jr. (@HankJr) <a href=#>August 8, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=786 data-injectable=true>On August 8, 1975, Williams was mountain climbing with a friend and his son – a favorite pastime for the country boy – when the unthinkable happened. While climbing Ajax Peak, a mountain along the continental divide that separates Montana from Idaho, looking for mountain goats Williams lost his footing. Despite the late season, the snow was still thick in the icy mountains obscuring the precarious footing and as the snow sheet slid away from the mountain, Williams went with it.</p><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>He fell more than 500 feet, tumbling through snow, rock, and mountain detritus before he finally came to a stop. Though he doesn’t remember much of the experience, he does remember desperately hoping to slow himself. He recounted the ordeal for a 1987 ABC interview, “You wanna stop so bad, but you can’t stop.” He says it with a smile even as the horrific details follow, “There was a sharp boulder.” He motions between his eyes, up over his face, continuing, “It did the job, right between the ol’ eyes.”</p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>Though Williams doesn’t remember much of the fall save for the sound of hitting the rock, he was very lucid after the accident. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">says his immediate instinct</a> was to check his hands. Once he was sure he could still hold a guitar, he tried to assess where most of the blood was coming from and discovered it was his face, “The blood was coming out and I grabbed my face and there wasn’t any face there, hardly.”</p><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>His fellow hiker Dick Willey took some time to safely reach Williams, who was, by that point, trying to move himself to safety. “‘Bout the only thing he had left was the one eye.” Willey recounts the damage with a calculated nonchalance,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> the cool tact of a rancher.</a> “It literally tore his nose off. Drove it up through his head and blew a hole in his forehead, which exposed the brain.” It was that injury that instilled real fear in Williams, “ I could put my fingers into my forehead.”</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Fully in shock, Williams could feel nothing as Willey wrapped his face in a shirt. He was convinced he would be able to walk back to civilization, even as he realized the extent of his blood loss. Willey was able to convince Williams to stay back with his son, who became Williams’ temporary guardian while Willey went in search of help.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>Weeks before the accident, Williams had finished recording his breakthrough album, Hank Williams Jr. & Friends, and the extensive injuries made it likely that he would never sing again. Willey recalled the damage to his friend’s lower face as extensive, saying his jaw, teeth, and gums were “pretty much ruined.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The aftermath</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>The injuries should have killed Williams outright, but against all odds, he survived the fall and the six-hour wait for air evac to get him to the nearest hospital. His brain was fully exposed, shards of rock embedded in the soft tissue, and William’s doctor made sure to let him know it was nothing short of a miracle that he survived the ordeal.&nbsp;“You know how people say they have been born again? Believe me, you were.”</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>Williams had multiple skull fractures, and the extensive damage required 17 surgeries spread out over several years. The scarring led Williams to adopt a new look, thick sunglasses to hide his eyes, and a cowboy hat to conceal skin grafts over the metal plate in his skull.</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>Though in immense pain, Williams didn’t want company while recovering, the country music community rallied behind him. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Rolling Stone in</a> 2015&nbsp;that June Carter and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnny Cash</a> were there when he first woke, and the visit meant a lot to the young singer. “June put a cross on me and told me it was all going to be OK. I never knew if I would sing again or not, talk again or not, let alone think about what I was going to look like. It was a scary time.”</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>Despite the extent of his injuries, it would only be two years before Williams was back in the studio working on One Night Stands in 1977. Though it was three more years still before he put his experience into words with 1980’s “All in Alabama.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahmK1lmJa9sbHNnptmrJ9itaK6ymauoqScnq6uv4yjqWannmKutrPUrKtmcKSdenKFlm5m</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-hank-williams-jr-on-august-8th-1975.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-hank-williams-jr-on-august-8th-1975.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-hank-williams-jr-on-august-8th-1975.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-hank-williams-jr-on-august-8th-1975.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-hank-williams-jr-on-august-8th-1975.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-hank-williams-jr-on-august-8th-1975.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bryan-bickell-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bryan-bickell-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html>Bryan Bickell Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./resident-evil-2-mod-swaps-claire-captain-marvel.html>New Resident Evil 2 Mod Swaps Claire With Captain Marvel</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./resident-evil-2-mod-swaps-claire-captain-marvel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
